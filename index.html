			<h2> Ligma</h2>

			<p>
				Ligma is a fictional disease associated with a death hoax orchestrated by Instagram user <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ninjahater1/"target = "_blank">@ninja_hater</b></a> that claimed Fortnite streamer Ninja had passed away after contracting the disease. The intention of this joke was to prompt concerned fans to ask what Ligma is, to which participants in the hoax would respond with <i>"ligma balls"</i> ("lick my balls"), a joke setup similar to <b>Deez Nuts and Updog</b>. The hoax also spawned in-jokes about the fictional nationality <i>Sugondese</i> ("suck on these"), the Indonesian city <i>Grabahan</i> ("grab a hand") and the fictional diseases <i>Sugma</i> ("suck my") and <i>Bofa</i> ("both of").
